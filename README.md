# Unity Coded TextMesh Pro

## YouTube

This project is to support any videos
about programmatic control of TextMesh Pro in Unity
for the 
[Designer Tech Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE3nwVJoAMB5QOp14R3eZqw/).

## Setup

This project is C# code only.
There are no materials, images
or scene files.
This helps the code be useful
across a broader range of modern
Unity installs where TextMesh Pro
is available.

The code will give compile errors in Unity unless
TextMesh Pro package is installed. Install TMP using the
Unity Package Manager.

ZIP file `scenes-for-Unity2019.3.zip` provides scene files
for Unity 2019.3 but you need
to unpack it to use it.

## Components

If you using Unity Editor Add Components menu you will see
a DesignerTech entry with the components from this project.

There are three components you can add to a scene
to get different outcomes.

1. Resizer (demonstrates dynamic RectTransform sizing)
2. Rescaler (demonstrates using scale on image / panel)
3. AnimatableLayout (shows how to manipulate anchors)
